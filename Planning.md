The two objects that are going to be interacting ("a circle and a rectangle," for instance) 
I want to do circle and square and make them bounce off walls and each other.
How you will know– or, more accurately, how you will describe to the computer which conditions the variables that represent those objects need to be in to consider that– the objects are touching
I will make the hitboxes clear for both shapes and set boundaries using dx dy and cx cy for the circle and square
what will happen when the objects touch. A simple statement is fine "They will bounce off one another," but I'd recommend you give it some programmatic thought: "I will swap the dx and dy variables for each object"
I want to make the objects bounce off the walls and once they bounce of the walls to eventually bounce off each other and then keep bouncing in coding languge I will swap the dx and dy varibles and set clear boundaries.
